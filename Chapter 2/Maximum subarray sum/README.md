```
Given an array of n numbers, our task is to calculate the maximum subarray sum, i.e., the largest possible sum of a sequence of consecutive values in the
array2
. The problem is interesting when there may be negative values in the
array. For example, in the array

**−1 2 4 −3 5 2 −5 2**

the following subarray produces the maximum sum 10:
**2 4 −3 5 2 **

We assume that an empty subarray is allowed, so the maximum subarray
sum is always at least 0.
