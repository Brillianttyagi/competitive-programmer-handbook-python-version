Binary Search Algorithm
-----------------------
* Binary search is a fast search algorithm with run-time complexity of ÎŸ(log n).
* This search algorithm works on the principle of divide and conquer.
* For this algorithm to work properly, the data collection should be in the sorted form.
* Binary search looks for a particular item by comparing the middle most item of the 
  collection.
* If a match occurs, then the index of item is returned.
* If the middle item is greater than the item, then the item is searched in the 
  sub-array to the left of the middle item.
* Otherwise, the item is searched for in the sub-array to the right of the middle item.
* This process continues on the sub-array as well until the size of the subarray reduces
  to zero.

Time Complexity
---------------
Best Case: O(1)
Average Case: O(log n)
Worst Case: O(log n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
